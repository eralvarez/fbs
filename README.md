## Important notes

Not sure if this will ever hit a stable version. This library was created to share basic Firestore functions across multiple projects.

That being said, the API could change between minor versions.

All collaborations will be appreciated. Feel free to raise an issue or PR in github.

## Compatibility

We will make our best to make it compatible with browser and server. But ATM the priority is browser and React/NextJS/ReactNative.
